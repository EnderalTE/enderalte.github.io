# The Yen Lab
---
Hello and welcome to the Yen Lab-an overarching foundation for my personal homelab and cyber lab.

üè† **The Home Lab**
My **home lab** is a self-hosted environment designed for learning, tinkering, and everyday use. Running on Proxmox, it hosts media servers, TrueNAS cloud storage, monitoring dashboards, and automation tools. While this is intended to be a learning experience, the ultimate goal is to create a fully automated homelab with automatic updates, backups, and status logs.

üõ°Ô∏è **The Cyber Lab**
Based on Grant Collins' Project Security, my **cybersecurity lab** is a professional, enterprise-style environment designed to showcase my technical depth in security.
